                            Variable rates can save you money when rates are low, but they can also lead to higher payments if rates go up. They’re best if you can repay quickly or take on some risk.

                            Refinancing involves replacing your existing personal loan with a new one, often to secure a lower interest rate or adjust the loan term. For example, refinancing from a 12% to an 8% interest rate can save you money.

                    The loan amount depends on the lender, your credit score, income, and DTI ratio. Personal loans typically range from $1,000 to $50,000, though some lenders may offer higher amounts for well-qualified borrowers.

                <div class="faq-text">
                    The loan term is the amount of time you have to repay the loan, typically ranging from 12 months to several years. Longer terms generally result in lower monthly payments but higher total interest costs. Shorter terms have higher payments but save you money on interest.

                <div class="faq-text">
                    DTI is the percentage of your monthly income that goes toward debt payments. Lenders generally prefer DTIs below 36%, though some may accept higher ratios depending on the loan type. A lower DTI shows lenders you can manage your debts responsibly.

                    Origination fees are one-time charges for processing your loan application, typically ranging from 1-5% of the loan amount. Some lenders waive these fees, so it’s worth comparing options to find the most cost-effective loan.
