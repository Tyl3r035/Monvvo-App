                            Principal is the original loan amount borrowed from a lender to purchase a home. Over time, as you make monthly mortgage payments, the principal decreases. For example, if you buy a home for $300,000 and make a $60,000 down payment, your principal loan amount will be $240,000.

                            The principal directly affects your monthly mortgage payment and the total interest you’ll pay over the life of the loan. Paying down the principal faster (e.g., through extra payments) can save you thousands of dollars in interest.

                            Interest is the cost you pay to borrow money from a lender, calculated as a percentage of the principal loan amount. For example, if your loan has a 4% annual interest rate, this percentage is applied to your remaining loan balance over time.

                            APR represents the total annual cost of borrowing, including the interest rate and additional fees like loan origination, points, and closing costs. It provides a more comprehensive view of a loan’s true cost compared to just the interest rate.

                            The loan term is the time period over which you agree to repay your mortgage, often 15, 20, or 30 years. Shorter terms typically come with higher monthly payments but lower overall interest costs, while longer terms offer lower monthly payments but higher total costs.

                            The down payment is the upfront amount you pay toward the purchase price of a home, usually expressed as a percentage. For example, a 20% down payment on a $250,000 home is $50,000. Down payments reduce the loan amount and may eliminate the need for additional insurance, such as PMI.

                            PMI is a type of insurance required by lenders when your down payment is less than 20% of the home’s purchase price. It protects the lender in case you default on the loan but does not benefit you as the borrower.

                            Understanding amortization helps you plan for long-term costs. Extra payments toward the principal can accelerate payoff and reduce total interest paid.

                            Pre-approval is a lender’s conditional commitment to offer you a loan based on your financial information, including credit score, income, and debt. It provides an estimated loan amount and interest rate.

                <div class="faq-text">
                    To qualify for a mortgage, lenders generally consider your credit score, income, debt-to-income ratio (DTI), employment history, and the size of your down payment. Strong credit and a low DTI ratio typically improve your chances of approval and better interest rates.

                <div class="faq-text">
                    The required down payment depends on the loan type:
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Conventional loans typically require 5-20%.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            VA and USDA loans may allow 0% down.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    A larger down payment may reduce your loan amount and could eliminate the need for Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI).

                <div class="faq-text">
                    Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI) is often required if your down payment is less than 20% of the home’s purchase price. PMI protects the lender, not you. You can generally avoid PMI by making a 20% down payment or reaching 20% equity in your home and requesting its removal.

                <div class="faq-text">
                    <b>Fixed-rate mortgage:</b> Your interest rate stays the same throughout the loan term, offering predictable monthly payments.
                    <br>
                    <b>ARM:</b> Provides a lower initial interest rate for a fixed period (e.g., 5 years), then adjusts periodically based on the market. ARMs are typically better for short-term ownership but may lead to higher payments over time.

                <div class="faq-text">
                    A good rule of thumb is to keep your housing expenses (mortgage, taxes, and insurance) below 28% of your gross monthly income and total debt payments under 36%. However, affordability varies based on your financial situation. Use a mortgage calculator for a more tailored estimate.

                <div class="faq-text">
                    Your DTI ratio is the percentage of your monthly income that goes toward debt payments, including your mortgage. Lenders generally prefer DTIs below 36%, though some may accept up to 43%. A lower DTI improves your chances of approval and may lead to better terms.

                <div class="faq-text">
                    Closing costs typically range from 2-5% of the loan amount and may include fees like appraisals, title insurance, and loan origination. The exact amount depends on your lender and location, but some lenders may allow you to roll these costs into your loan.

                <div class="faq-text">
                    Your credit score generally impacts your interest rate and loan terms. Higher scores (700+) typically qualify for lower interest rates, saving you money over the life of the loan. Lower scores may result in higher costs or stricter requirements.

                <div class="faq-text">
                    An escrow account is typically managed by your lender to cover property taxes and homeowner’s insurance. A portion of your monthly mortgage payment is deposited into this account to ensure these expenses are paid on time.

                <div class="faq-text">
                    Many lenders allow you to pay off your mortgage early without penalties, though some loans may have prepayment terms. Paying extra toward your principal generally reduces your loan balance faster and saves you money on interest.

                <div class="faq-text">
                    Equity is the difference between your home’s market value and the amount you owe on your mortgage. Building equity generally increases your net worth and provides options like refinancing or taking out a home equity loan.
