                            An annuity is a financial product that provides guaranteed income in retirement, either for a set number of years or for life, in exchange for an upfront investment.

                <div class="faq-text">
                    The amount you need to retire depends on your desired lifestyle, expenses, and how long you expect to be retired. A common guideline is to aim for 70-80% of your pre-retirement income annually. Generally, financial advisors recommend saving at least 10-15 times your annual salary by retirement age.

                <div class="faq-text">
                    It’s generally best to start saving for retirement as early as possible to take advantage of compound interest. If you haven’t started yet, it’s never too late—start now and contribute as much as your budget allows.

                <div class="faq-text">
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>401(k):</b> An employer-sponsored retirement account that allows you to contribute pre-tax income, often with employer matching.</li>
                        <li><b>IRA (Individual Retirement Account):</b> A self-managed retirement account with tax benefits, available in two forms: Traditional (tax-deductible contributions) and Roth (tax-free withdrawals).</li>
                    </ul>
                    Both are great tools, and you can contribute to both if eligible.

                <div class="faq-text">
                    You should aim to contribute at least 15% of your income toward retirement, including any employer match. If that’s not possible, start small and increase contributions as your income grows. At a minimum, contribute enough to get your employer’s 401(k) match if available—it’s essentially free money.

                <div class="faq-text">
                    A Roth IRA allows you to contribute after-tax income, and your withdrawals in retirement are tax-free, including investment growth. Roth IRAs are typically a good choice for younger savers or those who expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.

                <div class="faq-text">
                    Social Security provides monthly income in retirement based on your earnings history. While it’s a valuable resource, it’s generally not enough to cover all your expenses. Most retirees use it as a supplement to personal savings and investments.

                <div class="faq-text">
                    Catch-up contributions allow people aged 50 and older to contribute more to their retirement accounts. For example, in 2025, individuals can contribute an additional $7,500 to a 401(k) and $1,000 to an IRA. These contributions help boost savings later in life.

                <div class="faq-text">
                    Use a retirement calculator to estimate your future savings, income, and expenses. Review your progress regularly, and adjust your contributions or investment strategy if needed. Working with a financial advisor can also help you stay on track.

                <div class="faq-text">
                    It depends on your situation:
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>High-interest debt (e.g., credit cards):</b> Pay it off first, as it costs more than most investments earn.</li>
                        <li><b>Low-interest debt (e.g., a mortgage):</b> You can often save for retirement and pay off this debt simultaneously.</li>
                    </ul>
                    Balancing debt repayment with retirement savings is generally the best approach.

                <h3 class="faq-title">How do I create a retirement budget? <img class="faq-arrow" src="../img/icons/down-arrow-white.svg" alt="down arrow"></h3>
                <div class="faq-text">
                    Start by estimating your retirement expenses, including housing, healthcare, travel, and everyday needs. Compare this to your expected income sources, like Social Security, pensions, and savings withdrawals. A retirement budget helps ensure your money lasts.

                <h3 class="faq-title">What are required minimum distributions (RMDs)? <img class="faq-arrow" src="../img/icons/down-arrow-white.svg" alt="down arrow"></h3>
                <div class="faq-text">
                    RMDs are mandatory withdrawals from retirement accounts like 401(k)s and Traditional IRAs, starting at age 73 (or 72 if born before 1951). These withdrawals are taxed as income, and failing to take them can result in penalties.

                <h3 class="faq-title">Should I invest more conservatively as I approach retirement? <img class="faq-arrow" src="../img/icons/down-arrow-white.svg" alt="down arrow"></h3>
                <div class="faq-text">
                    Typically, yes. As retirement nears, shifting to a more conservative investment strategy (e.g., increasing bonds or cash equivalents) helps protect your savings from market downturns. However, some growth investments are often still necessary to keep up with inflation.

                <div class="faq-text">
                    The 4% rule suggests withdrawing 4% of your retirement savings annually, adjusted for inflation, to make your money last 30 years. While it’s a helpful guideline, your withdrawal rate should be based on your specific needs and market conditions.

                <div class="faq-text">
                    Yes, many retirees work part-time to stay active, supplement their income, or pursue interests. However, earning additional income may impact your Social Security benefits or tax bracket, depending on your total income.

                <h3 class="faq-title">How do I plan for healthcare costs in retirement? <img class="faq-arrow" src="../img/icons/down-arrow-white.svg" alt="down arrow"></h3>
                <div class="faq-text">
                    Healthcare is a significant expense in retirement. Consider:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Enrolling in Medicare (available at age 65).</li>
                        <li>Saving in a Health Savings Account (HSA) if eligible.</li>
                        <li>Budgeting for out-of-pocket costs, including long-term care insurance.</li>
                    </ul>
                    Planning ahead helps ensure these costs don’t derail your financial goals.
