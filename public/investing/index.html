                    You can start investing with as little as $100 or even less, depending on the platform or type of investment. Many brokers allow fractional share purchases, making it easier to invest small amounts. The important part is starting early and contributing consistently.

                    <ul>

                <div class="faq-text">
                    Diversification means spreading your investments across different asset classes (e.g., stocks, bonds, real estate) to reduce risk. If one investment performs poorly, others may balance it out. A diversified portfolio generally provides more stable returns over time.

                    Your risk tolerance determines how much market fluctuation you’re comfortable with. Younger investors with longer time horizons can generally take on more risk (e.g., stocks), while those nearing retirement might prioritize stability (e.g., bonds).

                <div class="faq-text">
                    Compound interest is when the returns on your investments generate even more returns over time. It’s often referred to as “earning interest on interest.” Starting early and letting your investments compound is one of the most powerful ways to grow wealth.

                    Index funds are mutual funds or ETFs designed to track the performance of a market index, like the S&P 500. They typically have low fees and provide instant diversification. For most investors, index funds are a simple, cost-effective way to build long-term wealth.

                <div class="faq-text">
