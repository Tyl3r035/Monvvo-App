                            DTI is the percentage of your gross monthly income that goes toward debt payments, including loans, credit cards, and other obligations. For example, if you make $5,000 a month and your total debt payments are $1,500, your DTI is 30%.

                            Credit utilization is the percentage of your available credit that you’re currently using. For example, if your credit limit is $10,000 and your balance is $3,000, your credit utilization is 30%.

                            Credit utilization is a major factor in your credit score. Keeping it low (under 30%) shows lenders you’re responsible with credit, which can help you qualify for better interest rates and loan terms.

                <div class="faq-text">
                    To create a budget, start by tracking your income and expenses. Categorize your spending (e.g., housing, transportation, food, savings) and set limits for each category. Generally, the 50/30/20 rule works well: 50% for needs, 30% for wants, and 20% for savings or debt repayment.

                    It’s generally recommended to save 3-6 months’ worth of living expenses in an emergency fund. However, the exact amount depends on your personal situation, such as job stability and monthly expenses. Start small and build up over time.

                    Two common strategies for paying off debt are:

                        <li><b>Debt snowball:</b> Pay off the smallest balances first for quick wins, then move to larger debts.</li>
                        <li><b>Debt avalanche:</b> Focus on paying off debts with the highest interest rates first to save on interest costs.</li>
                    </ul>

                <div class="faq-text">
                    A good rule of thumb is to save at least 20% of your income. This can include contributions to retirement accounts, emergency funds, and investments. If 20% isn’t feasible, start with a smaller amount and increase it over time.

                <div class="faq-text">
                    It depends on your situation:
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>High-interest debt (e.g., credit cards):</b> Prioritize paying it off first.</li>
                        <li><b>Low-interest debt (e.g., student loans):</b> You can often balance debt repayment with saving or investing.</li>
                    </ul>
                    Building an emergency fund while paying off debt is typically a good starting point.

                <div class="faq-text">
                    A DTI ratio below 36% is generally considered good, with anything below 20% being ideal. A lower DTI ratio shows lenders that you manage your debt well and may improve your chances of qualifying for loans or credit.
