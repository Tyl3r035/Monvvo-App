            <p class="article-text">
                A credit score is one of the most important numbers in your financial life. It influences everything from loan approvals to interest rates and even job applications. Despite its importance, many people don’t fully understand how credit scores work or how to improve them.
            </p>
            <p class="article-text">
                Misunderstanding your credit score can lead to missed opportunities and higher borrowing costs. Without a strong credit profile, accessing affordable credit or favorable terms becomes more challenging.
            </p>
            <p class="article-text">
                This guide will explain what a credit score is, why it matters, and actionable strategies to improve yours over time. By understanding and managing your credit score, you can unlock better financial opportunities and build a secure future.
            </p>

            <h2 id="what-is-credit-score" class="article-heading">What Is a Credit Score?</h2>
            <p class="article-text">
                A credit score is a three-digit number that represents your creditworthiness, or how likely you are to repay borrowed money. Credit scores typically range from 300 to 850, with higher scores indicating better creditworthiness.
            </p>
            <h3 class="article-subheading">Why It Exists</h3>
            <p class="article-text">
                Lenders use credit scores to evaluate the risk of lending money to a borrower. A strong credit score signals reliability, increasing your chances of approval for loans, credit cards, and favorable terms.
            </p>
            <h3 class="article-subheading">Major Credit Bureaus</h3>
            <p class="article-text">
                The three major credit bureaus—Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion—collect information from creditors to calculate your credit score. Each bureau’s data may vary slightly, so your score could differ depending on which bureau is used.
            </p>
            <h3 class="article-subheading">Types of Credit Scores</h3>
            <p class="article-text">
                The most common scoring models are the FICO Score and VantageScore. Both use similar criteria, but the exact algorithms may differ slightly.
            </p>

            <h2 id="components" class="article-heading">Components of a Credit Score</h2>
            <h3 class="article-subheading">Payment History</h3>
            <p class="article-text">
                This is the most important factor, accounting for 35% of your score. Consistently paying bills on time is crucial for maintaining a good credit score.
            </p>
            <h3 class="article-subheading">Credit Utilization</h3>
            <p class="article-text">
                Your credit utilization ratio—how much of your available credit you’re using—makes up 30% of your score. Keeping utilization below 30%, and ideally under 10%, can boost your score.
            </p>
            <h3 class="article-subheading">Length of Credit History</h3>
            <p class="article-text">
                The length of time your credit accounts have been active accounts for 15% of your score. Avoid closing old accounts unnecessarily, as they help establish a longer credit history.
            </p>
            <h3 class="article-subheading">Credit Mix</h3>
            <p class="article-text">
                Having a mix of credit types, such as credit cards, auto loans, and mortgages, contributes 10% to your score. A diverse credit portfolio signals responsible borrowing behavior.
            </p>
            <h3 class="article-subheading">New Credit</h3>
            <p class="article-text">
                New credit inquiries and recently opened accounts make up 10% of your score. Space out applications to avoid a negative impact from multiple hard inquiries.
            </p>

            <h2 id="why-scores-matter" class="article-heading">Why Credit Scores Matter</h2>
            <h3 class="article-subheading">Impact on Borrowing</h3>
            <p class="article-text">
                Your credit score determines your eligibility for loans, credit cards, and mortgages. Higher scores often lead to better terms, including lower interest rates, saving you money over time.
            </p>
            <h3 class="article-subheading">Other Areas of Impact</h3>
            <p class="article-text">
                Credit scores affect more than just borrowing. Landlords may check your score before renting an apartment, insurers might use it to set premiums, and some employers review credit reports during hiring.
            </p>

            <h2 id="improving-scores" class="article-heading">How to Improve Your Credit Score</h2>
            <h3 class="article-subheading">Pay Bills on Time</h3>
            <p class="article-text">
                Automate payments to ensure bills are paid by their due dates. Payment history is the largest factor affecting your credit score.
            </p>
            <h3 class="article-subheading">Reduce Credit Card Balances</h3>
            <p class="article-text">
                Lowering your credit utilization ratio by paying down balances can significantly improve your score.
            </p>
            <h3 class="article-subheading">Monitor Your Credit Report</h3>
            <p class="article-text">
                Regularly check your credit report for errors or inaccuracies. Dispute any incorrect information promptly to prevent it from affecting your score.
            </p>
            <h3 class="article-subheading">Keep Old Accounts Open</h3>
            <p class="article-text">
                Older accounts contribute to the length of your credit history. Unless they have high fees, keeping them open can benefit your score.
            </p>
            <h3 class="article-subheading">Avoid Opening Too Many Accounts</h3>
            <p class="article-text">
                Space out new credit applications to minimize the impact of hard inquiries on your score.
            </p>

            <h2 id="tools" class="article-heading">Tools and Resources for Monitoring Credit</h2>
            <h3 class="article-subheading">Free Credit Reports</h3>
            <p class="article-text">
                Access your credit reports from Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion at AnnualCreditReport.com.
            </p>
            <h3 class="article-subheading">Credit Monitoring Apps</h3>
            <p class="article-text">
                Use apps like Credit Karma or Mint for real-time updates, personalized tips, and monitoring your credit score over time.
            </p>
            <h3 class="article-subheading">Score Simulators</h3>
            <p class="article-text">
                Tools that allow you to see how specific actions, such as paying off debt or opening a new account, might affect your credit score.
            </p>

            <h2 id="conclusion" class="article-heading">Conclusion</h2>
            <p class="article-text">
                Your credit score is more than just a number—it’s a critical factor that influences borrowing, renting, and employment opportunities. By understanding the components of your credit score and taking steps to improve it, you can unlock better financial opportunities.
            </p>
            <p class="article-text">
